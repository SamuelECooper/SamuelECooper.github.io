[Examples of recent scientific questions include:]{.ul}

1.  How do patterns of generalized fear and avoidance, and their covariation, relate to adaptive and maladaptive personality structure?

2.  Does degree of fear or avoidance generalization differ by gender, and what underlying psychological processes can help explain potential gender differences?

3.  Does a novel experience, relative to a non-novel experience, promote maintenance of a weakly encoded fear memory if both the initial conditioning and novel experience share perceptual feature

4.  What is the state of the evidence for conditioning models of OCD, and are deficits in acquisition and/or extinction of conditioned fear consistently found in the disorder?

5.  Can we reliably place OCD symptoms within a larger framework of adaptive personality and psychopathology, such that these symptoms can be identified as a constituent of the larger framework?
