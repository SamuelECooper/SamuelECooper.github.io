I received my PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Minnesota's Clinical Science and Psychopathology and Research Program in 2019. I study human fear and anxiety, and their precipitants, mechanisms, and consequences. Although fear and anxiety are relevant for everyone, the majority of my work has particular relevance for PTSD and OCD. I largely use classical and instrumental conditioning paradigms as a framework for my research. Measurement modalities include psychophysiology, neuroimaging, eye-tracking, cognitive testing, and good ol' asking people about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences (i.e., interviews and questionnaires). More recently, I have become interested in using multivariate approaches to examine the structure of psychopathology, and then link that structure and broadband personality individual differences to neurobehavioral fear and anxiety mechanisms. Relatedly, I am a member of the [Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)](https://renaissance.stonybrookmedicine.edu/) consortium, which works to advance the empirical classification of psychopathology using quantitative techniques.

I am also the current editor of the [Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP)](http://www.sscpweb.org) newsletter, [Clinical Science](http://www.sscpweb.org/clinicalscience). If interested in writing for an upcoming issue, please don't hesitate to contact me!
