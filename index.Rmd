<img src="images/frank%20and%20sam.jpg" align="right" width="150" height="150" style="padding: 10px"/> I received my PhD in clinical psychology from the University of Minnesota in 2019. Since then, I have been a postdoctoral fellow in the [Dunsmoor Lab](https://sites.utexas.edu/dunsmoorlab/) at the University of Texas at Austin in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.

I study fear, anxiety, and their precipitants, mechanisms, and consequences. Although fear and anxiety are relevant for everyone, the majority of my work has particular relevance for PTSD and OCD. I largely use classical and instrumental conditioning paradigms as a framework for my research. Measurement modalities include psychophysiology, neuroimaging, eye-tracking, cognitive testing, and good old asking people about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences (i.e., interviews and questionnaires). More recently, I have become interested in using multivariate approaches to examine the structure of psychopathology, and then link that structure to fear and anxiety mechanisms.
