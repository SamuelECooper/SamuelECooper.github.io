# Mental Health

I received most of the my clinical training in the VA system, and thus naively thought it was straightforward for find science-based mental health services everywhere (i.e., outside of the VA). I was wrong. Below are some links to help with that.

[Anxiety and Depression Association of America: Find Help](https://adaa.org/find-help)

[Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies: Find Help](https://www.abct.org/Help/?m=mFindHelp&fa=dFindHelp)
